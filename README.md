# LeetCode Solutions

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository of **LeetCode solutions**! This repository contains my personal solutions to various coding challenges found on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com). The primary purpose of this repository is to document my journey through algorithm and data structure problems, and to serve as a reference for myself and others who are preparing for software engineering interviews.
<br>
<br>
## Repository Structure
Each problem from LeetCode has its dedicated folder in this repository. Inside each folder, you'll find:
- The solution file(s) with my code.
- A README.md file containing the problem description directly extracted from LeetCode.
  
The folders are named after the LeetCode problem titles for easy navigation and reference.
<br>
<br>
## Usage
This repository is intended for educational purposes. You can use them to compare with your own solutions, learn new approaches, or to prepare for coding interviews. However, I encourage you to first attempt the problems on your own before looking at the solutions here.

## Disclaimer
This repository is not affiliated with LeetCode. The solutions are based on my personal approach to the problems and are not the only way to solve them. Please use these solutions responsibly and ethically.
